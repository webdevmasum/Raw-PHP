**********
For Loop
**********
Syntax:
    for (initialization; condition; increment/decrement) {
        // Code to be executed
    }

Example:
    <?php
        for ($i = 1; $i <= 5; $i++) {
            echo "Number: $i <br>";
        }
    ?>

Explanation:
    $i = 1: Initialization of the loop variable.
    $i <= 5: Condition to continue the loop as long as $i is less than or equal to 5.
    $i++: Incrementing $i by 1 after each loop iteration.    

Output:
    Number: 1
    Number: 2
    Number: 3
    Number: 4
    Number: 5


**********
While Loop
**********

Syntax:
    while (condition) {
        // Code to be executed
    }

Example:
    <?php
        $i = 1;
        while ($i <= 5) {
            echo "Number: $i <br>";
            $i++;
        }
    ?>

Explanation:
    $i = 1: This sets the starting value of $i to 1.
    $i <= 5: This checks if $i is 5 or less. If true, the loop keeps going.
    $i++: This increases $i by 1 after each loop.    

Output:
    Number: 1
    Number: 2
    Number: 3
    Number: 4
    Number: 5


**********
Do-While Loop
**********

Syntax:
    do {
        // Code to be executed
    } while (condition);

Example:
    <?php
        $i = 1;
        do {
            echo "Number: $i <br>";
            $i++;
        } while ($i <= 5);
    ?>

Explanation:
    $i = 1: Start with $i set to 1.
    do { ... }: The code inside the do block will run at least once.
    $i <= 5: After running the code, it checks if $i is 5 or less. If true, it will run again.
    $i++: Each time the loop runs, $i increases by 1.   

Output:
    Number: 1
    Number: 2
    Number: 3
    Number: 4
    Number: 5


**********
Foreach Loop
**********

Syntax:
    foreach ($array as $value) {
        // Code to be executed
    }

Example:
    <?php
        $colors = ["Red", "Green", "Blue", "Yellow"];
        foreach ($colors as $color) {
            echo "Color: $color <br>";
        }
    ?>

Explanation:
    $colors: The array with a list of colors.
    $color: A variable that holds each color from the array one by one.
    The foreach loop goes through each color in the array and prints it.

Output:
    Color: Red
    Color: Green
    Color: Blue
    Color: Yellow
