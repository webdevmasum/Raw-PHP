    $_GLOBALS: An associative array containing references to all global variables in the script.
    $_SERVER: Contains information about the server and the execution environment.
    $_REQUEST: Contains the contents of $_GET, $_POST, and $_COOKIE.
    $_POST: Contains data sent through HTTP POST requests.
    $_GET: Contains data sent through URL query strings.
    $_FILES: Contains information about uploaded files.
    $_ENV: Contains environment variables.
    $_COOKIE: Contains data sent through cookies.
    $_SESSION: Used for session variables.


Variable:

    Definition: A storage that can hold data, and the data can be changed during program execution.
    Value: Can be updated.
    Syntax (PHP): $variableName = value;



Constant:

    Definition: A storage whose value is fixed once set and cannot be changed.
    Value: Cannot be updated after declaration.
    Syntax (PHP): define('CONSTANT_NAME', value); or const CONSTANT_NAME = value;



Sure! Here's a short explanation in English:
Variable:

    Definition: A storage that can hold data, and the data can be changed during program execution.

    Value: Can be updated.

    Syntax (PHP): $variableName = value;

    Example:

    $name = "John";
    $name = "Doe"; // Value updated

Constant:

    Definition: A storage whose value is fixed once set and cannot be changed.
    Value: Cannot be updated after declaration.
    Syntax (PHP): define('CONSTANT_NAME', value); or const CONSTANT_NAME = value;

    Example:

    define('SITE_NAME', 'MyWebsite');

Key Differences:

    Mutability: Variables can change; constants cannot.
    Usage: Variables for changeable data, constants for fixed values.
    Declaration: Variables use $, constants use define or const.
